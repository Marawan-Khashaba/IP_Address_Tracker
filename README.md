# IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app. To get the IP Address locations, I have been used the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, I have been used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
